* To learn about formulating applied machine learning problems, consider taking this course (its free): [Causal Diagrams: Draw Your Assumptions Before Your Conclusions](https://www.edx.org/course/causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your)
* Analogical thinking and story telling are important to recognise opportunities for algorithmic solutions, I'd strongly recommend the following book as a fun read: Christian, Brian, and Tom Griffiths. Algorithms to live by: The computer science of human decisions. Macmillan, 2016. [amazon] [pdf]
